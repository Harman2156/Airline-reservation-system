# ✈️ AeroLux - Airline Reservation System

Hi there! This is a simple **Airline Reservation System** I built using **HTML**, **TailwindCSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal was to create a clean and interactive flight booking interface where users can select flights, enter their details, and confirm their booking in real time — all on the frontend.

---

## 📌 What This Project Does

- Allows users to choose from available flights  
- Takes passenger name, email, and seat count  
- Gives instant confirmation once the form is submitted  
- Fully responsive using TailwindCSS  
- Everything runs inside a single `index.html` file (no backend needed)  

---

## 🎯 Why I Made This

I wanted to explore how airline systems work and challenge myself with a real-world example that uses basic web technologies. Airline reservation systems are everywhere in the travel industry, and this project gave me hands-on experience with form handling, UI/UX design, and client-side logic.

## 🛠 Technologies I Used

- **HTML** – To create the form structure  
- **TailwindCSS** – To style everything quickly and responsively
